            <h2>What kinds of creative photoshoots will you do?</h2>
            <p>
                If you need any shots for your model book, fashion, lifestyle or other portraits similar, feel free to shoot me an email! I’m also open to collaborating if you’re a makeup artist, clothing designer, or other creative who has a vision. I love working with small business, new influencers or creatives who are just starting out and want to work together.

            <h2>What are your rates?</h2>
            <p>
                I can be flexible since I work mostly with small or new creatives. We can talk rates and I’m willing to work with you. Generally, I work in packages and flat rates that depend on what you’re looking for. Because it varies, contact me for an exact estimate.

            <h2>What types of events do you photograph?</h2>
            <p>
                Events where you may need photos for your social media or website. This can be a new business opening, a club event, a gallery opening, parties, networking events, corporate events, etc.

            <h2>What photogaphy do you <u>not</u> do?</h2>
            <p>
                At this time I don’t do weddings, maternity, or family portraits, but I will be happy to recommend some amazing photographers to you!

            <h2>Do you charge hourly for events?</h2>
            <p>
                For events, I work in packages because the hours I work go beyond just the event itself. Overall, a package rate is better because it’s a flat rate no matter the time spent on editing, traveling, etc. The event rate includes the time spent at the event taking photos, the editing time and any overhead, and the final edited images.

            <h2>Do you give out RAW files or unedited JPGS?</h2>
            <p>
                No, for any photoshoots or events, all my rates and packages include editing. I do not give out RAW files or unedited photos. The only exception would be if you are a fellow photographer who needs a second shooter and the payment includes RAW files.
