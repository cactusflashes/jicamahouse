    <h1>Hello,<br> I'm Renee.</h1>
    <div class="text-spacer"></div>
    <p>Located in San Francisco, CA but born
        and raised in the Sonoran desert, 
        I’m a proud Latina photographer with 
        over 15 years of experience with my camera.

        My website is dedicated to my love of 
        documenting the world around me through my
        camera. I’ve never been a purist or a 
        perfectionist; my style is colorful, 
        cluttered, and I hope, tells a story. 
        I believe photography is more than perfect 
        lighting and composition; what makes a good
        photo is conveying an emotion or story from
        the photographer to their audience.

        I started working professionally at my local PBS/NPR
        station as a studio camera operator, eventually going
        on to shoot and produce stories in the field. I was
        an associate producer for feature length documentaries
            and went on to work as a project manager for videographers,
            graphic designers, and web developers.

        As the story goes, I eventually started to climb those corporate 
        ladders and became an Operations Director, but soon started feeling
        the loneliness and anxiety of corporate environments and missed 
        using my creativity.

        At the end of 2022, I had a health crisis that caused me stop 
        and evaluate who I wanted to be and what I wanted to do with my
        one precious life. I decided to leave my job, pick my camera 
        back up, and started Jicamahouse Photography.

        I’ve been spending time healing and rediscovering what I loved 
        about photography and documenting my daily life around the city.
